# Online Examination System
I built a full-stack Online Examination System using Spring Boot and React. It supports role-based authentication using JWT. Admin can create exams and manage questions. Students can attempt timed exams. The system auto-evaluates answers and stores results in MySQL. I also implemented random question generation and result analytics.
